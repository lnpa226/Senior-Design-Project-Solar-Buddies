# Senior-Design-Project-Solar-Buddies
This is the code used for the solar tracking project for Newton's Attic. 
It includes the offical code for the tracking and display subsystems. 
The tracking code was tested and updated throughout the project.
The display code has separate 'test' codes used to build the different portions of the subsystem.

These can be used to help understand the software used in the solar tracking project.
